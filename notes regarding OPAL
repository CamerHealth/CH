The documentation online for the OPAL Open Healthcare framework using Django/AngularJS/Bootstrap is still being worked on.  
Will need to have additional code and features to be rigorously tested :)


The Opal Framework requires Python 2.7 and Django 1.8.7.

If you have Python 3 running as default Python environment, do not forget to run the server, using
-- "python2 manage.py runserver"
